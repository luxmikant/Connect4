🤖 **Smart AI Bot** - Challenge an intelligent bot using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning  
⚡ **Auto Matchmaking** - 10-second queue with automatic bot fallback  
📊 **Kafka Analytics** - Real-time game metrics and player behavior tracking via Apache Kafka  
🏆 **Live Leaderboard** - Track rankings, win rates, and player statistics  
🔄 **Session Persistence** - Automatic reconnection with 30-second grace period  

## Features

- **Real-time multiplayer gameplay** via WebSocket connections
- **Intelligent bot opponents** using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- **Automatic matchmaking** with 10-second timeout fallback to bot games
- **Player reconnection support** with 30-second session persistence
- **Live leaderboard** with player statistics and rankings
- **Kafka-powered analytics** - Tracks gameplay metrics, player behavior, game duration, and peak hours

## Architecture

- **Go Backend Server**: Game logic, WebSocket communication, REST API
- **React Frontend**: User interface for gameplay and leaderboard
- **PostgreSQL**: Game data and player statistics storage
- **Kafka**: Analytics event streaming
- **Redis**: Session management and caching

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 18+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Make (optional, for convenience commands)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd connect4-multiplayer
   ```

2. **Set up credentials** (Choose one option)
   
   **Option A: Interactive Setup (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   make setup-credentials
   ```
   
   **Option B: Manual Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create environment file
   make create-env
   
   # Edit .env with your Supabase and Confluent Cloud credentials
   # See CREDENTIALS_SETUP.md for detailed instructions
   ```
   
   **Option C: Local Development Only**
   ```bash
   # Use local services (no cloud setup required)
   make docker-up
   # Uses local PostgreSQL, Redis, and Kafka
   ```

3. **Validate your setup**
   ```bash
   # Test database and Kafka connections
   make test-db
   make test-kafka
   ```

4. **Install development tools**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   make migrate
   ```

6. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

The server will start at `http://localhost:8080` with hot reload enabled.

# Analytics
make run-analytics   # Start Kafka analytics consumer
```

## 📊 Kafka Analytics

The system includes **real-time analytics** powered by Apache Kafka. Game events are published to Kafka and consumed by an analytics service that tracks:

- **Gameplay Metrics**: Average game duration, games per hour/day, min/max duration
- **Player Metrics**: Unique players per hour, active games, player win rates
- **Event Tracking**: All game events (started, moves, completed) stored for analysis

### Running Analytics Service

```bash
# Build analytics consumer
go build -o analytics.exe ./cmd/analytics

# Run analytics service
./analytics.exe
```

### Viewing Analytics Data

```sql
-- View latest analytics snapshot
SELECT 
    timestamp,
    games_completed_hour,
    games_completed_day,
    avg_game_duration_sec,
    unique_players_hour
FROM analytics_snapshots
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Most frequent winners
SELECT username, games_won, win_rate 
FROM player_stats 
ORDER BY games_won DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

📖 **For detailed analytics guide, see [docs/kafka-analytics-guide.md](docs/kafka-analytics-guide.md)**
