## 2026-01-04 - Win Detection Property Tests & Documentation

### Features Completed
- **Property Test for Win Detection (Task 3.3)**: Implemented comprehensive property-based tests for win and draw detection
  - Horizontal 4-in-a-row detection across all valid positions
  - Vertical 4-in-a-row detection across all valid positions
  - Diagonal win detection (both ↘ and ↙ directions)
  - Draw detection for full boards without winners
  - Game engine integration tests for win/draw conditions
- **Game Engine Strategy Documentation**: Created `docs/game-engine-strategy.md`
  - Board representation and data structures
  - Move validation flow diagrams
  - Win detection algorithm with scanning boundaries
  - Game state machine visualization
  - Error handling strategy
  - Performance considerations
- **Practical Implementation Guide**: Created `docs/game-engine-implementation.md`
  - Working code examples for all game operations
  - Interactive game loop implementation
  - REST API and WebSocket integration examples
  - Unit and property-based test examples

### Challenges Faced
- **Draw Detection Pattern Issue**: Initial alternating pattern for draw tests was creating 4-in-a-row wins
  - **Root Cause**: Simple `(row+col)%2` alternation creates diagonal patterns that can form wins
  - **Solution**: Created a specific pattern `[R,R,Y,R,R,Y,R]` alternating by row that breaks all possible 4-in-a-row combinations
  - **Prevention**: When testing draw conditions, manually verify the pattern doesn't contain any winning combinations

- **Gopter Sample() Return Values**: Initial code assumed single return value from generator Sample()
  - **Root Cause**: Gopter's Sample() returns `(value, ok bool)` tuple
  - **Solution**: Updated all Sample() calls to handle both return values
  - **Prevention**: Always check gopter documentation for function signatures

### Technical Decisions
- **Simplified Property Test Generators**: Instead of complex struct generators, used direct board manipulation
  - Rationale: More readable, easier to debug, and guarantees valid test states
- **Fixed Draw Pattern**: Used hardcoded pattern instead of random generation for draw tests
  - Rationale: Ensures deterministic, reliable tests without false positives
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Created both strategy and implementation docs
  - Rationale: Strategy doc explains "why", implementation doc shows "how"

### Test Results
```
+ horizontal 4-in-a-row should be detected as win: OK, passed 100 tests
+ vertical 4-in-a-row should be detected as win: OK, passed 100 tests
+ diagonal 4-in-a-row (TL-BR) should be detected as win: OK, passed 100 tests
+ diagonal 4-in-a-row (TR-BL) should be detected as win: OK, passed 100 tests
+ full board without winner should be detected as draw: OK, passed 100 tests
+ non-full boards without 4-in-a-row should not detect winner or draw: OK, passed 100 tests
+ game engine correctly identifies win conditions: OK, passed 100 tests
+ game engine correctly identifies draw conditions: OK, passed 100 tests

### Challenges Faced
- **Kafka Windows Compilation Issue**: Analytics service fails to compile on Windows
  - **Root Cause**: CGO linking errors with confluent-kafka-go library on Windows
  - **Symptoms**: `undefined reference to '__imp__vsnprintf_s'` and `_setjmp` errors
  - **Impact**: Analytics service cannot be built, but main server works perfectly
  - **Solutions Documented**: Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide with 5 different solutions

### Technical Decisions
- **Pure Go Kafka Library**: Recommended switching to `segmentio/kafka-go` for Windows compatibility
- **Docker Containerization**: Alternative solution for consistent cross-platform builds
- **Development Priority**: Focus on main server development while analytics runs in Docker

### Current Status

- `internal/config/config.go` - Fixed environment variable loading
- `migrations/*.sql` - PostgreSQL compatibility fixes
- `.env` - All cloud service credentials configured

### Next Steps
1. Implement REST API endpoints (main development path)
2. Address Kafka compilation using pure Go library (when analytics needed)
3. Set up Docker containers for consistent builds
4. Continue with WebSocket implementation

### Knowledge Gained
- Windows CGO compilation challenges with C libraries

## 2026-01-05 - Kafka Analytics Integration Fixed ✅

### Features Completed
- **Analytics Producer Integration**: Connected game service to Kafka producer
  - Game events now sent to Kafka when games are created, completed, or players disconnect/reconnect
  - Asynchronous event publishing to avoid blocking game operations
  - Full integration between main server and analytics consumer
- **Database Migration**: Created `analytics_snapshots` table for metrics persistence
  - Hourly/daily game completion counts
  - Average game duration tracking
  - Unique player counts
- **End-to-End Kafka Flow Validated**:
  - Server → Kafka Producer → Confluent Cloud → Kafka Consumer → Database
  - All event types working: game_started, game_completed, player_joined, player_left, player_reconnected

### Challenges Faced
- **Missing Analytics Producer Integration**: Game service was storing events in DB but not sending to Kafka
  - **Root Cause**: Analytics producer was not wired into the game service
  - **Solution**: Added `AnalyticsProducer` interface to game service and integrated in main.go
  - **Prevention**: Always verify end-to-end data flow when implementing event-driven systems

- **Missing analytics_snapshots Table**: Analytics service failed to flush metrics
  - **Root Cause**: Migration 007 hadn't been run on the database
  - **Solution**: Ran `go run cmd/migrate/main.go` to create the table
  - **Prevention**: Always run migrations after adding new migration files

### Technical Changes
- `internal/game/service.go`: Added `AnalyticsProducer` interface and integration
- `cmd/server/main.go`: Initialize and wire analytics producer to game service
- Database: Created `analytics_snapshots` table via migration 007

### Validation Results
- ✅ Game creation sends `game_started` event to Kafka
- ✅ Analytics service receives and processes events
- ✅ Player stats created automatically for new players
- ✅ Metrics flushed to `analytics_snapshots` table every minute
- ✅ Both server and analytics service running on Windows

### Current Status
- ✅ Kafka producer integrated with game service
- ✅ Analytics consumer processing events
- ✅ Metrics persistence working
- ✅ End-to-end Kafka flow validated
- 🔄 Task 13 (Integration Testing) in progress

### Files Changed
- `internal/game/service.go` - Added AnalyticsProducer interface and integration
- `cmd/server/main.go` - Initialize analytics producer and wire to game service
- `.kiro/steering/devlog.md` - Updated with fix documentation

### Next Steps
1. Complete Task 13.1 - End-to-end testing with cloud services
2. Complete Task 13.2 - Performance and load testing
3. Task 14 - Production readiness and deployment

## 2026-01-05 - Full Project Diagnostics & Test Fixes ✅

### Features Completed
- **Full Project Diagnostics**: Ran comprehensive diagnostics on all project files
- **Test Infrastructure Fixes**: Fixed duplicate mock declarations and missing interface methods
- **Code Compilation Fixes**: Fixed unused imports and type mismatches

### Issues Fixed
1. **Duplicate MockGameService in matchmaking tests**
   - **Root Cause**: Same mock declared in both `service_test.go` and `service_property_test.go`
   - **Solution**: Created shared `mocks_test.go` file with single mock declaration

2. **Missing GetQueueStatus in MockMatchmakingService**
   - **Root Cause**: WebSocket property tests had incomplete mock implementation
   - **Solution**: Created `internal/websocket/mocks_test.go` with complete mock

3. **Board type mismatch in handler.go**
   - **Root Cause**: Passing `session.Board` (value) instead of `&session.Board` (pointer)
   - **Solution**: Added address-of operator to pass pointer
